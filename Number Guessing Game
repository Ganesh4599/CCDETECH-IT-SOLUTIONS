Number Guessing Game
In this task, I Developed a program where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and
the player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.
And It Provides hints like "too high" or "too low" after each guess.

import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberGuessingGame {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Random random = new Random();

        int lowerBound = 1;
        int upperBound = 100;
        int targetNumber = random.nextInt(upperBound - lowerBound + 1) + lowerBound;
        int maxAttempts = 10;
        int attempts = 0;

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!");
        System.out.println("I've selected a random number between " + lowerBound + " and " + upperBound + ". Try to guess it!");

        while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
            System.out.print("Enter your guess: ");
            int guess = scanner.nextInt();
            attempts++;

            if (guess < lowerBound || guess > upperBound) {
                System.out.println("Please guess a number between " + lowerBound + " and " + upperBound + ".");
                continue;
            }

            if (guess == targetNumber) {
                System.out.println("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number " + targetNumber + " in " + attempts + " attempts.");
                break;
            } else if (guess < targetNumber) {
                System.out.println("Too low. Try again!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Too high. Try again!");
            }
        }

        if (attempts == maxAttempts) {
            System.out.println("Sorry, you've run out of attempts. The correct number was " + targetNumber + ".");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
